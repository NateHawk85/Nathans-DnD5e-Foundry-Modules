# What's this about?
I figured making a separate page for upgrade notes would be prudent. There are a variety of great things that were anticipated by 0.8.x, however there are some
module shortcomings as well. Here, I'll try to list any main differences between my prior Foundry 0.7.9 setup and the current version.

## Notes
New modules (mostly libraries) installed
- Lib Dif Hotkeys?? 
- Keybind lib (image hover)
- Acelib (macro editor)
- Settings extender (pings)
- Probably some more, but I lost track of them. Seems like lots of libraries, which is awesome for module developers!

Item Macro (Had to reinstall, but was updated)

Item Collection (everything's disappeared from bags!) --> Back up your world, go to the GitLab page, go to the Changelog.md page, and run the 1.8.0 migration
script... or just copy and paste from here: `await Itemcollection.migrateWorld();` Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to restore coinage.

Forien's Quest Log (old macro does not pop quest log menu) --> Macro switched from `QuestLog.render(true);` to `Hooks.call('ForienQuestLog.Open.QuestLog');`

Token Hotbar issue (selecting/deslecting tokens caused lots of error messages to appear) --> Adjust Token Hotbar to point to Custom Hotbar and the messages go away

Pressing play in Calendar/Weather module does not start the time --> This has to do with a setting in Simple Calendar. Select the Simple Calendar menu (top left
button in menu, then select the calendar icon). Click configure. General settings, Game World Time Integration, and set setting to Mixed. Additionally, if your 
calendar is all over the place, import Calendar/Weather into Simple Calendar or vice-versa.

## High Priority Non-Updated Modules
- Conditional Visibility (Does not work at all)
- Condition Automation (Blinded still works, seems unaffected)
- Find the Culprit (Seems unaffected)
- Give item to another player (DOES NOT WORK, only works if the recipient already has the item the giver is sending. Replaced by Let's Trade 5e)
- GM Secret Block (Seems unaffected)
- Playlist Importer (Seems unaffected)
- RC Spent/Recoverable Ammo Tracker (Not working since update)
- Tidi UI - Game Settings (Seems unaffected)
- Token Hotbar (One small bug, but still seems to work as long as it's combined with Custom Hotbar and settings are changed)
